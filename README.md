interview with Antoine


Link to the presentation for minimal product

We could not use CSS libraries like bootstrap nor import basic components like a navigation bar so everything had to 
be done mostly from scratch. One of the team mate wanted to use te twilio API, the react map API and DialogFlow API to abstract some complexity but we really wanted to make everything mostly from scratch to better understand the fundementals.

I was responsible for the workflow of the team and division of tasks. The main components I worked on where the navigation bar, user-admin interface
basic state management across the application, general visual design choices, admin-user interface and finnaly a clippy style 
helper interface for the admin-user

The admin user helper was more of a challenge then a necessity but I really wanted to mess around with NLP and Recurrent Neural
Nets. During developpement he had multiple names refering 
to sci-fi AI's ( Ultron, sky_net ... ) 

It was first implemented in Python because of the massive community and documentation for RNN implementations and we did not
have the time to fully implement it in React but It was not a major feature and is functionallity did not depend on the 
rest of the app since he was interacting with the database.

Alot of time was spent to animate him with CSS to sharpen my understanding of CSS.
